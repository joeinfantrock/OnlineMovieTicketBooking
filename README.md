# OnlineMovieTicketBooking
**Simple Project for Online Movie Ticket Booking** <br>
Hello, I am Joe and this is my third project, which is a simple Online Movie Ticket Booking website. <br> <br>

**What it does** <br>
1) First of all, it asks for login, if new, then register. Then you can choose your preferred movie and number of tickets. <br>
2) You can then choose the seat details. <br>
3) You then get a confirmation for your ticket :) <br>
4) The Customer details are all stored in the MySQL Database. <br>
<br>

**Background story of how this project was made and tools used** <br>
I made this project for my college mini project. I did this when i was in my first year.<br>
This is a really simple project. <br>
I have used Python, Flask Framework and used Eclipse IDE. I used Pydev on Eclipse Marketplace to use Python in Eclipse. <br>
I have also used HTML templates, CSS for styling and JavaScript, for actions after button clicking. JavaScript is not used much, but to just experiment with what it does. <br>
Many Images were also used, to enhance the quality of use, which I have included in the Project.

# Framework used: Flask <br>
Command:
> pip install Flask

# Code to include Ionicons in html <br>
```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.js"></script>
```

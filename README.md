# OnlineMovieTicketBooking
**Simple Project for Online Movie Ticket Booking** <br>
Hello, I am Joe and this is my third project, which is a simple Online Movie Ticket Booking website. <br>
This is a really simple project <br>
I made this project for my college mini project. I did this when i was in my first year.<br>
I have used Python, Flask Framework and used Eclipse IDE. I used Pydev on Eclipse Marketplace to use Python in Eclipse. <br>
I have also used HTML templates, CSS for styling and JavaScript, for actions after button clicking. JavaScript is not used much, but to just experiment with what it does. <br>

# Framework used: Flask <br>
Command:
> pip install Flask

# Code to include Ionicons in html <br>
```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.js"></script>
```
